This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

## Projects

- **[RoR-Blog](https://github.com/falkzone/RoR-Blog)** - This is a simple demo blog application written in Ruby on Rails.This blog diverges from the Getting Started Guide in that it uses the Bootstrap3 front-end framework.

- **[RSS-APP](https://github.com/falkzone/iRSS-APP)** - RSS for iPhone is a easy to use RSS reader. iRSS uses the combination of a UITableView and UIWebView to download and present an RSS feed to the user. iRSS is based on a Single View Application and works on iOS 9.0 and higher.

- **[Glittr.com offline]** - spin-off of MakeupBee that was designed to be more focused on mainstream looks and have a cleaner feel. I've written most of the code for this site.


## Misc

- **[Building your own portable oldies gaming console](https://github.com/daattali/rasperry-pi-gaming-console-setup)** - I bought a raspberry pi and turned it into an awesome portable gaming console that supports SNES/PS1/GameGear/GameBoy.  Super cool.

- **[Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)** - Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

- **[Middleman - Makes developing websites simple](https://github.com/middleman/middleman)** - Middleman is a static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development. Check out [middlemanapp.com](https://middlemanapp.com) for detailed tutorials, including a [getting started guide](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/getting-started/). You can also follow [@middlemanapp](https://twitter.com/middlemanapp) for updates.
