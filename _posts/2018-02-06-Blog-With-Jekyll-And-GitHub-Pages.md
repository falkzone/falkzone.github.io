I recently migrated one blog from WordPress to Jekyll, a fantastic website generator that’s designed for building minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub Pages. The simplicity of Jekyll’s theming layer and writing workflow is fantastic; however, setting up of the website took a lot longer than expected.

What is Jekyll? Jekyll is a website generator that’s designed for building minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

the quickest way to set up a Jekyll powered blog; how to avoid common problems with using Jekyll; how to import your content from WordPress, use your own domain name, and blog in your favorite editor; how to theme in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples; a couple of Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass and CoffeeScript support and collections.
